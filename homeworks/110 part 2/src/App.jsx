       <h1 className='how'>how do white whales eat</h1>
       <p className='eat'>As its mouth fills, a rorqual's throat grooves expand <br /> and its mouth cavity balloons outward. Then the whale brings its <br /> jaws together and contracts the throat grooves, forcing water <br /> out. Prey such as krill and small fishes are caught in the <br /> baleen mat as water is forced through the baleen and out the sides of the mouth.</p>

      <h1 className='how1'>how to  white  whales sleep</h1>
      <p className='sleep'>To be able to sleep, whales shut down half <br /> of their brain at a time. Being partially awake allows them to <br /> continue breathing and be aware of their surroundings. Whales will usually stay in <br /> place as they sleep near the surface. As they rest, they <br /> are switching which hemisphere of the brain is awake.</p>

      <h1 className='how2'>how do white  whales <br /> communicate</h1>
      <p className='communicate'>Whales are very social creatures that travel <br /> in groups called “pods.” They use a variety <br /> of noises to communicate  and socialize with each other. <br /> The three main types of sounds <br /> made by whales are clicks, whistles, <br /> and pulsed calls. Clicks are believed to be for navigation and identifying <br /> physical surroundings.</p>

    <div className="div4">
      <h1 className='how3'>how do white whales breath</h1>
      <p className="swim"> Whales and dolphins are mammals and breathe air <br /> into their lungs, just like we do. They cannot breathe underwater <br /> like fish can as they do not have gills. They breathe <br /> through nostrils, called a blowhole, located <br /> right on top of their heads. </p>
