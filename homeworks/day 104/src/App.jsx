          <h1 className="eat">How do lions eat?</h1>
           <h3 className='eating'>Feeding. Once a prey animal has been captured, <br /> lions first  feed on the viscera  then work their way through <br /> the fleshy parts of the carcass. Most prey animals <br /> have thick hides  and can most easily be entered through <br /> the soft skin of  the abdomen, which lions shear <br /> with their  carnassial teeth.</h3>

           <h1 className="hunt">How to lions hunt?</h1>

           <h3 className='hunting'>Lions either ambush approaching prey or move carefully <br /> to within striking distance. The final charge <br /> is usually less than 50 m; <br /> any further and the lion will overheat If the prey is captured, <br />the lion bites <br /> at the muzzle or throat to throttle it.</h3>
