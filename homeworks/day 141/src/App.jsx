On July 14 1789 the Paris mob,  hungry due to a lack  of food from poor harvests, <br /> upset at the conditions of their lives and annoyed with their <br /> King and Government, stormed the Bastille fortress (a prison). <br /> This turned out to be more symbolic than anything <br /> else as only four or five prisoners were found.</p>
